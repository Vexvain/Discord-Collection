make a custom method for dummies:

1. Learn some programming languages(python, javascript, C#, etc) & some website penetration testing
2. Gather Discord intel and start digging as much as possible. Use that info to find exploits
3. If an exploit is found that allows you to slither into someone's account or server, use it(obviously)
4. Use selfbot nuker :^)
