Note: This takes patient & you must be good at conversation.

1. Make an alt account and make a Discord bot that does what it's general or thingy is and make a command to invite a bot.
2. Make the server popular, now once your target server has invited your bot & trusted so they give em an administration role.
3. Make another bot that nukes, use the command to invite the bot then use that bot to nuke the server & make sure to add a code on the bot so whenever anyone joins except you gets kick automatically.
4. Now the problem here is the owner, If the owner sue the bot just tell him that maybe it got backdoor & say that you will investigate it.
5. Server nuked! It's risky but fun maybe and persistent too.
