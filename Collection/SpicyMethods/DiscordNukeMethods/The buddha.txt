This only works if the server has a staff/moderator/admin application form available. Be patient

1. Make an alt Discord account so your main one won't get banned(duh)
2. If the form is available, apply like you actually want it more than anything. If you don't get accepted then you've failed.
3. Once applied and accepted, be patient until you get to the position of mod/admin
4. Use a selfbot nuker to eat their cheeks
5. After the server has been pooped on, leave & change your pfp, name, and password(changes account ID)
