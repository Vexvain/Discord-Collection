Note: This only works If the server has a staff/moderator/admin application form, It's available & your patient.

1. Make a alt Discord account so your main one won't get ban.
2. If the form is available then apply & do your best also act like a good guy so there is a higher chance that you will get accepted or get a long with them.
3. Once applied and your accepted. You need to be patient to get to the position where you can ban, kick & etc server members.
4. Alright they have trusted you and they give you an admin role now use a selfbot nuker and nuke the server.
5. After the server has been nuked leave the server then change your name, profile picture & etc.
