Note: Probably one of the most painful feeling to have is when your friends backstabs you.

1. Make a fake Discord account & make it looks like your real account then join your target server.
2. Be friendly & stuff so people will like you, get attach to events & have bonding with the owner.
3. Then If the owner really trust you I'm sure they will 100% give you an admin role or moderator on the server.
4. Heres where the game starts. Use a selfbot server nuker to nuke the server or invite your nuker bot to nuke the server.
5. After nuked. Leave the server then change your name, profile picture & stuff.
